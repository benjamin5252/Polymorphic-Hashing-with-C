# Polymorphic-Hashing-with-C

# Description
An abstract data type with hash funtion is built with c.  <br />
The abstract data type assoc provide functions to quick check the existance of the data stored with double hash. <br />

# Technique used
malloc for size changing hash table. <br />
implementation of double hash. <br />
pointer to the input data for Polymorphic support. <br />

# Instructions
A sample test.c code is provided to show how users can use this abstract data type. <br />
